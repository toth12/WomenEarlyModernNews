# Abstract

Early modern Europe witnessed an unprecedented revolution in information culture. This gave rise to new means of communication that included handwritten news sheets. Throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, information circulated in the form of regular manuscript newsletters. Even though these newsletters had a significant impact on European history, their study has remained challenging. Most of the previously existing news sheets did not survive. Those that survived are dispersed in different collections around the world. These collections are somewhat random and incomplete samples. How can we unlock and study the lost early modern corpus of handwritten news? To tackle this problem, this study draws on various methods applied in dynamic system modeling and AI (Bootstrapping, Markovian Simulation, and Random Walks), as well as on Bayesian statistics and semantic modeling. Precisely, the paper investigates a collection of one thousand Italian manuscript newsletters from the Medici Archive (today part of the Florentine State Archive) with a focus on the representation of women in the news. First, it discusses how loss and incompleteness contribute to the randomness of archival collections. Second, it offers an accessible introduction to an array of methods that natural sciences and AI apply to tackle randomness and incompleteness. Third, by analyzing the representation and presence of women in early modern news, the paper presents these methods in action.
